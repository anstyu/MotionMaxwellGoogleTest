# MotionMaxwellGoogleTest

This is an independent testing project to test MotionMaxwellCoupling.dll. To use this project, you would first need to close this git repository under the AnsysDev folder of the EBU repository you are working on. For example,

``` shell
cd D:\repo1\AnsysDev
git clone https://github.com/anstyu/MotionMaxwellGoogleTest.git
```

And then you would need to open the **MotionMaxwellGoogleTest.sln** and build it. And then you would be able to run the tests from the test explorer.
